# ReconHardware

This is a repo for my research on reconfigureable hardware computing. Branching directories have a **README** outlining the relevant subdirectories if necessary.

### Directories

- **Documents**

  - Where my project documents have been hosted for preparation of presentations, paper submissions, etc...
- **FPGA_Files**

  - ***CPE*** - Design files for a custom AXIS convolution processor with BRAM line buffers. A static and dynamic design are shown.
  - ***PYNQ Files*** - PYNQ FPGA image for Pynq-Z2 and corresponding jupyter-notebooks that were tested. These are likely outdated as software was mostly moved to Vitis development.
  - ***Testing*** - This is basically just test files enviroment for myself. Feel free to view
