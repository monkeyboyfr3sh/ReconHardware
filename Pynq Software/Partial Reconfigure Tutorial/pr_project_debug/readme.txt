1. REVISION HISTORY 

            Readme  
Date        Version      Revision Description

2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files that come with UG947, the 
Partial Reconfiguration Tutorial for Vivado.

This design currently targets a single demonstration platforms and is used to 
highlight the project-based software flow with debug for Partial Reconfiguration.  


3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This tutorial requires Xilinx Vivado 2017.1 or newer. 
A Partial Reconfiguration license is required to run the implementation flow.


4. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY

The directory structure underneath this top-level folder is described below:

\Sources
 |
 +-----  \hdl
 |       Verilog source code is located within this folder.  All design sources are
 |       included here, so add them to the project according to the tutorial instructions.
 |
 +-----  \ip
 |       IP source code is located within this folder.  These are the IP for the static design
 |
 +-----  \xdc 
 |        This folder contains the design constraint file.
 |        Each filename includes an extension to define which device it targets.
 |        More constraint files to target more devices will be added in a future Vivado release
 |


5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Follow the instructions provided in UG947 Lab 4 to run the tutorial.

This lab steps throught the project support within the Vivado IDE.  There is no
automation within this lab.  Select the appropriate constraint file(s) to target one
of the listed supported boards.
