*************************************************************************

This project is self reconfiguring version of the up/down left/right PR tutorial
for the VCU108 board.  This design has been validated with Vivado 2018.1 and PRC version 1.3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Generate the PRC & other IP required for the design, then implement the design 
   ---------------------------------------------------
   vivado -mode tcl -source design.tcl

   Selection of the target board is done within this script.
   

2. Create a PROM file containing the static and the partials
   ---------------------------------------------------
   * This creates Bitstreams/pr_prom.mcs containing the static and the partials
   * NOTE: This contains hardwired addresses for the partials in the ROM.  
           It MUST match the hardwired addresses in pr_info_<board>.tcl 
   * NOTE: These sizes match bitstreams created by Vivado 2018.1 tools.
     
   vivado -mode tcl -source create_prom_file_<board>.tcl
    

3. Download the PROM image
   ---------------------------------------------------
   You will likely need to Refresh the device in Vivado Hardware Manager.
   Press the PROG button on the VCU108 to program the device from flash.
   

4. Reconfiguration is triggered by the NSEW buttons:
   ---------------------------------------------------
   N: Up counter
   S: Down Counter
   W: Shift Left
   E: Shift Right
   C: Reset
   

5. Using the AXI Interface
   ----------------------------
   In Vivado Hardware Manager, source this script file to set up prc commands
     source ./Sources/scripts/axi_lite_procs.tcl 
     prc_jtag_setup         
     prc_shutdown_vsm          vs_shift
     prc_show_rm_configuration vs_shift 0
     prc_show_rm_configuration vs_shift 1
     prc_decode_status         vs_shift

   Other commands exist to access the AXI IF  
     prc_read_register  reg_name
     prc_write_register reg_name data
