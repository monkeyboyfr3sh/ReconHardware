IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[0] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#2 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[1] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#3 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[2] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#4 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[3] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	Clk_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to U12
	Clk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
