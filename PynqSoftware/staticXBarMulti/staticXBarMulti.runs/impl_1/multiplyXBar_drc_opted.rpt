2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
24 out of 36 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: AddressSelect[4:0], bufferRD_in[3:0], bufferRD_out[3:0], mReady_in[3:0], mReady_out[3:0], outputSelect[1:0], mStart_out.

IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[0] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#2 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[1] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#3 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[2] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#4 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO dataIn[3] connects to flops which have these genblk3[0].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[1].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[2].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0], genblk3[3].m_computeBlock_in/psWrap/ParallelBuffer_0/inst/buff1/SR[0] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	Clk_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to U17
	Clk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
