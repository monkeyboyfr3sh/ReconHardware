PLCK-12#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets Clk_IBUF] >

	Clk_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to U17
	Clk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
24 out of 36 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: AddressSelect[4:0], bufferRD_in[3:0], bufferRD_out[3:0], mReady_in[3:0], mReady_out[3:0], outputSelect[1:0], mStart_out.

HDPR-26#1 Warning
Improper Pblock column boundary  
The Reconfigurable Pblock 'pblock_mCompute' has a 'left' edge that terminates on an improper column boundary at tile 'CLBLM_R_X37Y55' (SLICE_X54Y55 SLICE_X55Y55).
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON using the following constraint, or modify the X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
Example: set_property SNAPPING_MODE ON [get_pblocks 'pblock_mCompute']
Please refer to the Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration User Guide.
Related violations: <none>

HDPR-26#2 Warning
Improper Pblock column boundary  
The Reconfigurable Pblock 'pblock_mCompute_1' has a 'right' edge that terminates on an improper column boundary at tile 'CLBLL_L_X38Y55' (SLICE_X57Y55 SLICE_X56Y55).
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON using the following constraint, or modify the X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
Example: set_property SNAPPING_MODE ON [get_pblocks 'pblock_mCompute_1']
Please refer to the Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration User Guide.
Related violations: <none>

HDPR-26#3 Warning
Improper Pblock column boundary  
The Reconfigurable Pblock 'pblock_mCompute_3' has a 'right' edge that terminates on an improper column boundary at tile 'CLBLL_L_X40Y55' (SLICE_X61Y55 SLICE_X60Y55).
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON using the following constraint, or modify the X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
Example: set_property SNAPPING_MODE ON [get_pblocks 'pblock_mCompute_3']
Please refer to the Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration User Guide.
Related violations: <none>

HDPR-26#4 Warning
Improper Pblock column boundary  
The Reconfigurable Pblock 'pblock_mCompute_5' has a 'right' edge that terminates on an improper column boundary at tile 'CLBLL_L_X42Y55' (SLICE_X65Y55 SLICE_X64Y55).
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON using the following constraint, or modify the X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
Example: set_property SNAPPING_MODE ON [get_pblocks 'pblock_mCompute_5']
Please refer to the Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration User Guide.
Related violations: <none>

HDPR-26#5 Warning
Improper Pblock column boundary  
The Reconfigurable Pblock 'pblock_mCompute_7' has a 'left' edge that terminates on an improper column boundary at tile 'CLBLL_R_X51Y55' (SLICE_X80Y55 SLICE_X81Y55).
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON using the following constraint, or modify the X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
Example: set_property SNAPPING_MODE ON [get_pblocks 'pblock_mCompute_7']
Please refer to the Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration User Guide.
