2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell OutputSave_reg[0][3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) OutputSave_reg[0][0]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[0][1]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[0][2]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[0][3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell OutputSave_reg[1][3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) OutputSave_reg[1][0]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[1][1]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[1][2]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[1][3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell OutputSave_reg[2][3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) OutputSave_reg[2][0]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[2][1]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[2][2]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[2][3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell OutputSave_reg[3][3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) OutputSave_reg[3][0]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[3][1]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[3][2]/CLR, OutputSave_reg[3][3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
