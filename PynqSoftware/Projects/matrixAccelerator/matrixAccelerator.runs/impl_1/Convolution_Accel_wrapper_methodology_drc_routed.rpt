There is a large setup violation of -99.936 ns between Convolution_Accel_i/matrixAccTopDevice_0/inst/matrixAccel/genblk3[0].inputMulti/product_reg[14]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and Convolution_Accel_i/matrixAccTopDevice_0/inst/matrixAccel/genblk4[0].outputAdder/accumulate_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#60 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -99.951 ns between Convolution_Accel_i/matrixAccTopDevice_0/inst/matrixAccel/genblk3[0].inputMulti/product_reg[14]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and Convolution_Accel_i/matrixAccTopDevice_0/inst/matrixAccel/genblk4[0].outputAdder/accumulate_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
