# =======================================================================
# This test sets up the PRC to have 2 Virtual Sockets with 2 RMs each.
# It is based on the PR tutorial with the up/down counter and the 
# left/right shifter.
#

#  Set up some information about the design.  This isn't
#  strictly necessary but it's better to avoid magic 
#  numbers in the rest of the code

# "Shift" Virtual Socket ( ID 0)
