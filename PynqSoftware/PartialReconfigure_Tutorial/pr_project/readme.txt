1. REVISION HISTORY 

            Readme  
Date        Version      Revision Description
=========================================================================
18JUL2016	1.0			 Initial Xilinx release
03FEB2017	1.1			 Update for 2017.1
=========================================================================


2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files that come with UG947, the 
Partial Reconfiguration Tutorial for Vivado.

This design targets multiple demonstration platforms and is used to 
highlight the project-based software flow for Partial Reconfiguration.  


3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This tutorial requires Xilinx Vivado 2017.1 or newer. 
A Partial Reconfiguration license is required to run the implementation flow.


4. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY

The directory structure underneath this top-level folder is described below:

\Sources
 |
 +-----  \hdl
 |       Verilog source code is located within these folders.  There are folders
 |       for static logic (top) and each reconfigurable module variant
 |    
 |           +--\shift_left
 |           +--\shift_left_slow
 |           +--\shift_right
 |           +--\shift_right_slow
 |           +--\top
 |
 +-----  \xdc 
 |        This folder contains the design constraint files.
 |        Each filename includes an extension to define which device it targets.
 |           top.xdc is the complete constraint file for automatic scripted processing
 |           top_io.xdc contains pinout and clocking constraints
 |           pblocks.xdc contains the PR floorplan
 |           top_io.xdc + pblocks.xdc = top.xdc
 |


5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Follow the instructions provided in UG947 Lab 3 to run the tutorial.

This lab steps throught the project support within the Vivado IDE.  There is no
automation within this lab.  Select the appropriate constraint file(s) to target one
of the listed supported boards.


6. OTHER INFORMATION
