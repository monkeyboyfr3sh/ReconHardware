*************************************************************************

This project is self reconfiguring version of the up/down left/right DFX tutorial for the VCU118 board only.  
This design has been validated with Vivado 2020.1 and DFX Controller version 1.0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Generate the DFX Controller & other IP required for the design, then implement the design 
   ---------------------------------------------------
   vivado –mode tcl –source project_dfxc_vcu118.tcl

   Launch implementation from the resulting project, but do not generate bitstreams.

2. Compile the MicroBlaze code
   
   Follow instructions in Lab 7 to export hardware data to Vitis, then build an application project
   Add the resulting .elf file and associate it to the MicroBlaze instance.
   

3. Create BIT, BIN and PROM file containing the static and the partials
   ---------------------------------------------------
   * This creates Bitstreams/dfx_prom.mcs containing the static and the partials
   * NOTE: This contains hardwired addresses for the partials in the ROM.  
           It MUST match the hardwired addresses in dfxc_demo.h data file.
   * NOTE: These sizes match bitstreams created by Vivado 2020.1 tools.
     
   First, generate bitstreams from the impl_1 configuration within the Design Runs window.
   Then launch these scripts to create the remaining bitstreams and the QSPI flash image:
   source create_all_bitstreams_vcu118.tcl
   source create_prom_file_vcu118.tcl
    

4. Download the PROM image
   ---------------------------------------------------
   You will likely need to Refresh the device in Vivado Hardware Manager.
   Press the PROG button on the board to program the device from flash.
   

5. Reconfiguration is triggered by the NSEW buttons:
   ---------------------------------------------------
   N: Up counter
   S: Down Counter
   W: Shift Left
   E: Shift Right
   C: Insert CRC Error

   Reconfiguration from QSPI or DDR4 can be done via UART as documented in Lab 7.
   

6. Using the AXI Interface
   ----------------------------
   Connect to a terminal window connected to a COM port set at 115200 baud.
   Use the numbered menu items to load partial bitstreams, change delivery options and check status.
