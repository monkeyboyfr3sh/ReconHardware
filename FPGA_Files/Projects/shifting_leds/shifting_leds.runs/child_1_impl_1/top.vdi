Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-993] The Pblock pblock_shifter has defined an area that causes the splitting of interconnect tile columns. Dynamic Function eXchange requires that the left and right paired interconnect tile columns cannot be split by a reconfigurable boundary.  This is caused by either the left or right edge of a Pblock boundary, or by the Pblock spanning over logic types not included in the Pblock ranges.  To avoid an unroutable situation, placement will be prohibited from both of these columns. To avoid placement restrictions, modify the Pblock to avoid splitting the two columns.
The column of the split contains interconnect tile INT_L_X32Y49  (SLICE_X49Y49 SLICE_X48Y49).
Please refer to the Xilinx document on Dynamic Function eXchange.
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON, or modify the column/X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-996] The split between the left and right columns occurs between a reconfigurable Pblock and Static logic.  The static sites are not reconfigurable.  The Pblock should be adjusted to remove the column from the Pblock, unless the excluded reconfigurable and static sites are not needed for the design.  Note that adjusting the Pblock will prevent prohibits and improve placement of the design, but may reduce the routability if the removed sites were needed to span across the static logic.  Failure to modify the Pblock may lead to an unplaceable design if these prohibited sites are required by the design.
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON, or modify the column/X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-994] The following sites will be excluded from the left column in pblock_shifter:
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-992]   Site Type: SLICEL excluded sites: 100
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-995] The following sites will be excluded from the right column in Static:
