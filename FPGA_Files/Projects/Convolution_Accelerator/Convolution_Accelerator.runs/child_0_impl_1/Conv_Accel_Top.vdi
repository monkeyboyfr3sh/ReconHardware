Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-993] The Pblock pblock_2 has defined an area that causes the splitting of interconnect tile columns. Partial reconfiguration requires that the left and right paired interconnect tile columns cannot be split by a reconfigurable boundary.  This is caused by either the left or right edge of a Pblock boundary, or by the Pblock spanning over logic types not included in the Pblock ranges.  To avoid an unroutable situation, placement will be prohibited from both of these columns. To avoid placement restrictions, modify the Pblock to avoid splitting the two columns.
The column of the split contains interconnect tile INT_L_X60Y49  (SLICE_X95Y49 SLICE_X94Y49).
Please refer to the Xilinx document on Partial Reconfiguration.
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON, or modify the column/X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-997] The split between the left and right columns occurs between a reconfigurable Pblock and Static logic.  The static sites are reconfigurable.  The Pblock should either be extended to include the left column, or reduced to remove the right column.
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON, or modify the column/X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-994] The following sites will be excluded from the left column in pblock_2:
