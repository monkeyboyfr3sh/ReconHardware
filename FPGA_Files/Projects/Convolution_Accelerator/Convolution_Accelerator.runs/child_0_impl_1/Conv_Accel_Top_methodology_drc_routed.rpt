2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock processer/design_2_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_2_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_2_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_2_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_2_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT ConvAccel/controller/rbin_rep[7]_i_4 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT processer/rbin_rep[7]_i_4__0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock processer/design_2_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin processer/design_2_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell processer/finalAdder_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ConvAccel/matrixAccel/addPointer_reg[0]/CLR, ConvAccel/matrixAccel/addPointer_reg[1]/CLR, ConvAccel/matrixAccel/finalReady_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
