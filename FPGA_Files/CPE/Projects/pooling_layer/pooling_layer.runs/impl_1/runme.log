Phase 10 Post Router Timing

Phase 10.1 Update Timing
Phase 10.1 Update Timing | Checksum: 17b1e3a3f

Time (s): cpu = 00:03:20 ; elapsed = 00:02:01 . Memory (MB): peak = 2310.301 ; gain = 176.328
INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=-23.090| TNS=-19513.327| WHS=-0.533 | THS=-6.620 |

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
